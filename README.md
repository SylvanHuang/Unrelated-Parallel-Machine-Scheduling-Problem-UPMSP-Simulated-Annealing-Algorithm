Abstract. In this paper, we studied a real-world example of an unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem in which the Just-in-Time (JIT) inventory system, including Work-in-Process and Finished Goods inventories, is the center of in-terest. The presented Simulated Annealing Algorithm tackling the combinatorial problem is a part of the expert and intelligent production system that assists a De-cision Maker in perceiving his/her decisionâ€™s outcome in advance. Precisely not-ed, the problem statement is novel since the integration of inventory systems, and renewable and non-renewable resources engaged in manufacturing are taken into account. The undertaken manufacturing system could be attributed to the direct influence of management strategy of JIT inventory system not only to reduce the inventory level but also to minimize the earliness and tardiness cost responding to due dates. Moreover, the conventional parameters are reflected in the problem de-scription and solution methodology. In conclusion, the results are remarkable in two terms, the first is to obtain a better production planning in considerably less time, and secondly, a cost-benefit analysis tool to contrast the JIT approach with earliest possible completion time criterion. Finally, possible research directions are suggested for future studies. (150-250 words)
